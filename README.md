# Vue starter template
"Vue starter template" is a relatively small project, aiming to make it faster for you to get started working with Vue.js or to test a component, without polluting a current project.

"But why not just use vue-cli or [insert other tool name] instead?" I hear you ask. You could. No sugar-coating it, you definitely could. I just wanted to make my own, small project to quickly get started, trying out new components I stumble upon.

# How to use it
All you need to use is a little bit of NPM and git, then you're good to go.

```
git clone https://github.com/jebkor/vue-spa-starter
cd vue-spa-starter
npm install
npm start
```

And you're good to go! That wasn't so painful, was it?

# What's in the box!?
This project has a few languages "pre-installed" and should be good to go, right out of the gate.
- Javascript: Big surprise. But I am using javascript is ES6 syntax and use Babel to transpile it to ES5. This means that "modules" are supported, and therefor also "tree-shaking".
- Webpack: Yup, yet another webpack-driven project. It's using Webpack 4, and is using as minimal a setup as I deem possible.
- Vue: Do I have to explain myself?
- SCSS: I find that Sass (SCSS) is a great extension to the CSS language and makes everything *much* better. It's included in the main javascript file, so no extra compiler is required.
- Vuetify: Because I really like this framework, it's included here. Delete it if you don't approve
- VueRouter: Since it's a SPA, it seemed like a logical choice to me.

If you find a problem, feel free to open an issue OR try and fix it yourself and send a "pull request". Both would be highly appriciated.
